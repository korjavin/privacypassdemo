# Privacy Pass Interactive Demo

An interactive educational demonstration of the Privacy Pass protocol using Verifiable Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions (VOPRFs). This demo explains how privacy-preserving tokens work through hands-on examples and visual analogies.

## 🎯 What is Privacy Pass?

Privacy Pass is a cryptographic protocol that allows users to prove they're legitimate without revealing their identity. Think of it as anonymous admission tickets that can't be traced back to you.

### The Problem: Online Tracking

![Digital Tracking Problem](images/1.1.png)

Every website visit leaves digital "stamps" that data brokers use to build detailed profiles. This tracking undermines user privacy and creates comprehensive surveillance.

### The Solution: Anonymous Tokens

Privacy Pass provides anonymous tokens that prove legitimacy without traceability. Like paying cash for generic tickets versus using a trackable credit card for numbered seats.

## 🔐 How It Works

### The Carbon Paper Analogy

![Blind Signature Process](images/2.1.png)

Privacy Pass uses "blind signatures" - like having someone sign a sealed envelope containing your secret message. The signature goes through carbon paper, marking your document without the signer seeing its contents.

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Zero-knowledge proofs let you prove you know something without revealing what you know. Like proving you found Wally by showing only him through a small window, without revealing his location on the page.

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### VOPRF Protocol Flow

The Verifiable Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (VOPRF) protocol ensures:
- **Oblivious**: Server can't see what it's signing
- **Pseudorandom**: Outputs look random but are deterministic
- **Verifiable**: Client can verify the signature is correct

### Elliptic Curve Cryptography

Built on elliptic curve mathematics where point addition creates a "billiards-like" path on the curve. This provides the mathematical foundation for secure, efficient cryptographic operations.
