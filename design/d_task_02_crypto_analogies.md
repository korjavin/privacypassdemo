Task: Generate illustrations for the core cryptographic analogies.
Prompt 2.1: Carbon Paper Envelope
Prompt: "Generate a three-step diagram illustrating a blind signature using the carbon paper analogy. Step 1: A hand is shown placing a document with a secret message (represented by the word 'NONCE' in stylized text) into an envelope. A cutaway view of the envelope reveals its inner lining is made of dark carbon paper. Step 2: A different hand, holding a classic fountain pen, signs the outside of the sealed envelope with a flourish. Step 3: The envelope is shown opened, and the original 'NONCE' document is being removed. It now has a perfect carbon copy of the signature on it. The style should be a clean, technical blueprint or patent drawing style, with thin lines and a monochrome or duotone color scheme."
Prompt 2.2: Where's Wally ZKP
Prompt: "Create a fun, cartoonish illustration of the 'Where's Wally' zero-knowledge proof analogy. The scene is a large, incredibly crowded and detailed 'Where's Wally' style picture. One person (the 'Prover') is holding a massive black board that covers almost the entire scene. The board has a small, circular cutout in the center. Through this cutout, only the character 'Wally' (a man in a red-and-white striped shirt and hat) is visible. A second person (the 'Verifier') is peering through the hole with an oversized magnifying glass, looking convinced and impressed. The key is that the board is so large that the Verifier gets no contextual clues about where Wally is on the page. The style should be colorful, playful, and immediately understandable."
