Task: Generate visualizations for Elliptic Curve Cryptography concepts.
Prompt 4.1: Elliptic Curve Billiards
Prompt: "Create an educational diagram of elliptic curve point addition and scalar multiplication. Plot a standard elliptic curve (like secp256k1) on a 2D graph with X and Y axes.
Show a distinct point labeled 'G' (the generator point) on the curve.
To illustrate 'G + G = 2G', draw a tangent line to the curve at point G. Show where this line intersects the curve at a new point. Then draw a vertical line from that intersection point to its reflection across the x-axis. Label this final point '2G'.
To illustrate '2G + G = 3G', draw a straight line passing through points 'G' and '2G'. Show where this line intersects the curve at a third point. Draw a vertical line from that intersection to its reflection across the x-axis. Label this final point '3G'.
The lines representing the 'bounces' should be dotted or dashed to look like a path. The style should be clear and precise, like a modern mathematics textbook diagram, but with dynamic arrows to suggest motion."
