Task: Generate conceptual diagrams that provide high-level analogies for the core privacy problems and solutions.
Prompt 1.1: Digital Passport Analogy
Prompt: "Create a clean, minimalist infographic illustrating the concept of online tracking. On the left, a friendly, abstract user icon. From the user, draw multiple arrows pointing to various website logos (a social media bird, a shopping cart, a newspaper icon). As the arrows touch the logos, they should pick up small, distinct 'stamps'. An arrow then leads from the user to a sinister, shadowy 'Data Broker' icon on the right. This broker is shown assembling a detailed user profile using the collected stamps. The style should be modern vector art with a bright, friendly color palette for the user and websites, contrasting with a dark, slightly ominous feel for the data broker's section. Text labels: 'User Activity', 'Websites', 'Tracking Stamps', 'User Profile'."
Prompt 1.2: Anonymous Tickets Analogy
Prompt: "Create a two-part infographic comparing traceable vs. anonymous authorization. The top half is labeled 'The Problem: Traceable Tokens'. It shows a two-panel sequence. Panel 1: A user icon hands a credit card to a 'Token Vendor' and receives tickets, each with a unique serial number (e.g., #101, #102). Panel 2: The user hands ticket #101 to a 'Website Usher'. The usher looks at the ticket, then at a large screen that links '#101' directly back to the user's name and photo. A large red 'X' is superimposed. The bottom half is labeled 'The Solution: Anonymous Tokens'. It shows a similar two-panel sequence. Panel 1: The user hands generic cash to the vendor and receives a stack of identical, generic tickets with no markings. Panel 2: The user hands one generic ticket to the usher, who simply nods and lets them in. There is no screen and no way to link the ticket back. A large green checkmark is superimposed. Style should be simple, clear iconography, like airport safety instructions."
